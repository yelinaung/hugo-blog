      <description>Another rainy day.
SIM Cards!!
Another day, another interesting HN post. I saw this post What is AT&amp;amp;T doing at 1111340002?.
And the top was very interesting to me.
 Even in relatively technical circles, like HN, many people are not aware of this and I use every opportunity I have to reiterate:
  A SIM card is a full-blown computer with its own CPU and memory.
  Your carrier can upload and run arbitrary code without your consent or knowledge.</description>
