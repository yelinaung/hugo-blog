      <description>This is me writing down my discussion with someone from work regarding for loop vs list comprehension in Python.
During a code review, I was commenting on a chunk of code to change from for loop to a list comprehension. We also talked about why I wanted it that way. One reason is list comprehension could be (arguably) more readable than a for loop. For a simple loop, that might be the case.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been looking at how I can improve the performance of an internal service written in Python. I was wondering if there is a way to speed things up without rewriting large part of the code or using another programming language to rewrite part of the code. Then I remember reading about Pyston (a faster and highly-compatible with Cpython from Dropbox) on HackerNews and this seems like an opportunity to try it out.</description>
