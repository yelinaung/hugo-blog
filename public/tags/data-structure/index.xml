      <description>Things that I stumbled on a rainy day.
 Understanding how Trie (Data Structure) works Understanding how Raft (Distributed Consensus algorithm) works  Trie I have heard/seen it but not in detail until now. Saw someone posted about it on HN and makes me curious.
I also found post about Trie written in Python by Googling. I like the clear explaination with diagrams and put the code on github.
Some takeaways  Cool data structure to build autocomplete / prefix tree.</description>
