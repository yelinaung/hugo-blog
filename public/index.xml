      <description>Another raining day.
SIM Cards!!
Another day, another intersting HN post. I saw this post What is AT&amp;amp;T doing at 1111340002?.
And the top was very intersting to me.
 Even in relatively technical circles, like HN, many people are not aware of this and I use every opportunity I have to reiterate:
  A SIM card is a full blown computer with its own CPU and memory.
  Your carrier can upload and run arbitrary code without your consent or knowledge.</description>

      <description>Things that I stumbled on a rainy day.
 Understanding how Trie (Data Structure) works Understanding how Raft (Distributed Consensus algorithm) works  Trie I have heard/seen it but not in detail until now. Saw someone posted about it on HN and makes me curious.
I also found post about Trie written in Python by Googling. I like the clear explaination with diagrams and put the code on github.
Some takeaways  Cool data structure to build autocomplete / prefix tree.</description>
