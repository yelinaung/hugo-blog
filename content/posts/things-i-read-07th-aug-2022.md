#### Fun with Finite Automata

{{< youtube iBTwVyfH9eY >}}

Interesting talk about how Bryan Boreham made some optimization for Go regex packages.
Learned a bit about [Deterministic finite automaton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterministic_finite_automaton).

#### Tell HN: I have the perfect job, why is it not enough?

Interesting answers about feeling unfulfilled.

#### Avoiding Micromanagement

This is [the whole thread](https://twitter.com/rhein_wein/status/1547211754333036544) with context and what.

This is how I usually tell people about delegation.
- Outline the vision - what you want to be done / why / when to start / deadline
- Provide resources - Access, Resources, etc
- Describe the acceptance criteria of the task

Interesting for me as I can see a few more detailed steps.
