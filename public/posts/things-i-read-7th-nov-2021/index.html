SIM Cards!!
Another day, another intersting HN post. I saw this post What is AT&amp;T doing at 1111340002?.
And the top was very intersting to me.
 Even in relatively technical circles, like HN, many people are not aware of this and I use every opportunity I have to reiterate:
  A SIM card is a full blown computer with its own CPU and memory.

<p>Another day, another intersting HN post.
I saw this post <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29135559">What is AT&amp;T doing at 1111340002?</a>.</p>

<blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Your carrier can upload and run arbitrary code without your consent or knowledge. They can do this at any time.
This means that your &ldquo;phone&rdquo; is actually three different computers running in concert - the actual phone itself (iOS or Android or Symbian), the baseband processor running the baseband code, and the SIM card.</p>

<p>I did not know that!</p>
<p>Another thing is I have noticed something in the past is whenever I insert my SIM card, there would be some application appearing automatically.
The most likely explaination could be this</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This was driven home to me many years ago when I popped a SIM from a Mexican carrier that had an embedded Dominos Pizza app on it. Suddenly the Windows Mobile phone I was testing had a new icon on it.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Likely the app was not embedded in the sim. It was likely a carrier profile that the sim activated that triggered the download and install of the app.</p>

<p>And this DefCon talk from 2013 was awesome!</p>
